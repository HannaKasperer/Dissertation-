Fix the ‘problems’ of the code:
- In the “ExoPlex/burnman/utils/chemistry.py” file, replace the line in #31 with:
file = '../ExoPlex/burnman/data/input_masses/atomic_masses.dat'

- In the “ExoPlex/burnman/utils/misc.py” file, replace the line in #121 with:
datalines = open('../ExoPlex/burnman/data/'+filename).readlines()


Exercise #1
Make the my_planet.py program running
- Changing the Fe/Mg ratios [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2] and see how much the R and CMF changes (show in a plot)
- Change also the other elemental ratios and check the impact on R and CMF (show in a plot)


Exercise #2
- Take the M and R of the Solar System rocky planets and by changing the Fe/Mg ratio get the best composition of
the planet that matches the R. Compare the CMF with the reference values. The reference values of R, M, and
CMF can be found in Adibekyan+21.
- Take a star with M = 7.31 +/- 1.11 Mearth and R = 1.54 +/-0.14 Mearth. 
- By changing the Fe/Mg ratio get the best composition of the planet that matches the observed R.
- Repeat the process many times varying the M and R of the planet within their uncertainties to estimate the error
of CMF.
- From Table S4 of Adibekyan+21 select all the planets and perform a similar analysis to determine the CMF.
